# Documents for legacy-STRAIGHT

This directory consists of documents prepared for the legacy-STRAIGHT.

Please note that the legacy-STRAIGHT is an ended project. The latest extended morphing framework uses the TANDEM-STRAIGHT. Dr. Masanori Morise, who invented the core component of the TANDEM-STRAIGHT, also distributes an open-source VOCODER framework called WORLD. [Link to mmorise/WORLD](https://github.com/mmorise/World)

	* This conference paper introduces the latest F0 extractor for the legacy-STRAIGHT, called NDF. The performance of NDF is still competitive in practical situations.

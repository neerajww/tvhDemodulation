# Prism for speech? Time-varying sinusoidal demodulation for non-stationary modeling of speech
Speech signals contain a fairly rich time-evolving spectral content. Accurate analysis of this time-evolving spectrum is an open challenge in signal processing. Towards this, we visit timevarying sinusoidal modeling of speech and propose an alternate modele stimation approach. The estimation operates on the whole signal without any short-time analysis.

The repository contains the data and codes used in the study.
